## What Is Vue?

Vue (pronounced like "view") is a **JavaScript framework** that helps you build fast, modern user interfaces. It‚Äôs built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî tools you probably already know.

Instead of managing complex UIs manually, Vue lets you write **components** that react automatically when your data changes.

### üß™ A Quick Example

```js
import { createApp, ref } from 'vue'

createApp({
  setup() {
    return {
      count: ref(0)
    }
  }
}).mount('#app')
```

```html
<div id="app">
  <button @click="count++">
    Count is: {{ count }}
  </button>
</div>
```

**Result:**

> Count is: 0 (clicking the button increases the number)

## Why We Call Vue a "Progressive Framework"

Vue is designed to grow with you. Whether you‚Äôre enhancing a static site or building a full web app, Vue adapts to your needs.

You can use Vue for:

* Simple enhancements to static HTML
* Embedding components into existing sites
* Full single-page apps (SPAs)
* Server-side rendering (SSR)
* Static site generation (SSG)
* Even mobile, desktop, or terminal apps!

## Single File Components (SFCs)

As projects grow, Vue recommends using **Single File Components (SFCs)**. These `.vue` files bundle everything you need (JS, HTML, and CSS) into one place.

Here‚Äôs the earlier example, rewritten as a `.vue` file:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>

<style scoped>
button {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
```

## Two API Styles: Options vs. Composition

Vue lets you write components in **two styles**. Both work the same way under the hood:

### 1. Options API

You organize code into `data`, `methods`, and `lifecycle hooks`.

```vue
<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return { count: 0 }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    console.log(`The initial count is ${this.count}.`)
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

### 2. Composition API

You write logic inside a setup function using `ref`, `onMounted`, and other utilities.

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0)

function increment() {
  count.value++
}

onMounted(() => {
  console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)
})
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

## Which Should You Use?

Use what feels right to you:

* ‚úÖ **Options API** if you‚Äôre new to reactivity or coming from OOP languages.
* ‚úÖ **Composition API** for more control, cleaner logic reuse, and full app building.
