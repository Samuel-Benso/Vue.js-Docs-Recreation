# Vue.js-Docs-Recreation
Welcome to the Vue documentation repository! 

This project was created as part of the Technical Writing Mentorship Programme to practice and test my knowledge of using static site generatorsâ€”specifically Astro Starlight.

 
This repo hosts the source files for the Vue.js documentation website.

## About

This project contains all the markdown files, assets, and configuration used to build the Vue.js documentation site. It covers everything from getting started guides to advanced topics like the Composition API and migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3.

## How to Use

- **View the documentation**: The site is hosted live via [Vercel](https://vue-js-docs-recreation-88o3.vercel.app/)  
- **Edit the docs**: Clone this repo locally, make your changes, and push updates. The hosted site will update automatically on the next deployment.

## Development

To build and preview the documentation locally:

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the local server to preview changes:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

Make your changes in the source files, commit, and push to update the live site.
